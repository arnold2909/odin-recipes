    <h2>Ingerdients</h2>
    <div class="list-container">
      <ul>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">2.5 courgettes</li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">2 salmon fillets</li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">300g linguine</li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">50g red pesto</li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">½ lemon</li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">200g parmesan cheese</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <div class="list-container">
      <ol>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees. Boil a pot of water with ½ tsp of
          salt for your pasta.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          Chop the very top and bottom from your courgette. Slice the courgette
          lengthways into strips no thicker than ½cm. Now slice the slices
          lengthways to make strands less than ½cm thick. Tip: Really slice
          carefully to get thin linguine-like strands.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          Once the oven has pre-heated rub a little glug of olive oil into the
          salmon fillet. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides then
          place the fillet on a baking tray. Cook on the top shelf of the oven
          for 10 mins then remove.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          Add the pasta to the rapidly boiling water and cook for 6 mins or
          until 'al dente'. Tip: 'Al dente' simply means it is cooked through
          but has a hint of firmness left in the middle.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          When the pasta is 3 mins from done heat a tbsp of olive oil in a
          frying pan on medium-high heat. Peel and crush the garlic then add
          this to the pan for a minute. Once the oil is nice and hot add the
          courgette strands into the pan and toss them together with the garlic.
          Cook the courgettes until they go a bit floppy. Tip: Do not add salt
          yet as it'll make the courgette go soggy.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          Add the pesto into the frying pan with the courgette and squeeze in
          the juice of ½ lemon. Then, add a couple of tbsp of water and ¼ tsp of
          salt and a few good grinds of black pepper (don't be shy - it'll
          really boost the flavour). Now toss in the drained pasta and remove
          from the heat.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          The salmon is likely out of the oven by now so use two forks to pull
          apart the meat into little flakes. Discard the skin.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-list-item">
          Finally, toss the salmon flakes and ¾ of the grated cheese through the
          pasta. Serve with the remaining parmesan sprinkled on top and gobble!
          Oh and remember to take the garlic clove out as well - it was just
          there to add a subtle 'garlic-iness'.
