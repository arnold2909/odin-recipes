    <h2>Ingerdients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>2.5 courgettes</li>
      <li>2 salmon fillets</li>
      <li>300g linguine</li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>50g red pesto</li>
      <li>½ lemon</li>
      <li>200g parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Pre-heat your oven to 180 degrees. Boil a pot of water with ½ tsp of
        salt for your pasta.
      </li>
      <li>
        Chop the very top and bottom from your courgette. Slice the courgette
        lengthways into strips no thicker than ½cm. Now slice the slices
        lengthways to make strands less than ½cm thick. Tip: Really slice
        carefully to get thin linguine-like strands.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the oven has pre-heated rub a little glug of olive oil into the
        salmon fillet. Sprinkle a pinch of salt and pepper on both sides then
        place the fillet on a baking tray. Cook on the top shelf of the oven for
        10 mins then remove.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pasta to the rapidly boiling water and cook for 6 mins or until
        'al dente'. Tip: 'Al dente' simply means it is cooked through but has a
        hint of firmness left in the middle.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the pasta is 3 mins from done heat a tbsp of olive oil in a frying
        pan on medium-high heat. Peel and crush the garlic then add this to the
        pan for a minute. Once the oil is nice and hot add the courgette strands
        into the pan and toss them together with the garlic. Cook the courgettes
        until they go a bit floppy. Tip: Do not add salt yet as it'll make the
        courgette go soggy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the pesto into the frying pan with the courgette and squeeze in the
        juice of ½ lemon. Then, add a couple of tbsp of water and ¼ tsp of salt
        and a few good grinds of black pepper (don't be shy - it'll really boost
        the flavour). Now toss in the drained pasta and remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        The salmon is likely out of the oven by now so use two forks to pull
        apart the meat into little flakes. Discard the skin.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, toss the salmon flakes and ¾ of the grated cheese through the
        pasta. Serve with the remaining parmesan sprinkled on top and gobble! Oh
        and remember to take the garlic clove out as well - it was just there to
        add a subtle 'garlic-iness'.
      </li>
    </ol>
